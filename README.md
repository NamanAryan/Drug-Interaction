# 💊 Drug–Drug Interaction Predictor

This project uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict interactions between drug pairs based on their SMILES representations. It includes:
- A Streamlit dashboard with risk & clinical insights
- A real-time prediction notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Pretrained model and code

## 🚀 Features
- Binary DDI prediction using GCN
- SMILES → Graph conversion
- Confidence score, risk level, and clinical alert
- Real-time dashboard (both in Streamlit and Notebook)

## 📁 Files
- `app.py` – Streamlit frontend
- `model.py`, `utils.py` – GNN model and preprocessing
- `ddi_dashboard.ipynb` – Submission notebook
- `ddi_model.pt` – Trained PyTorch model
